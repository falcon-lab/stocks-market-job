## Running (localhost)

#### Build artifacts

- In the application root, run `mvn clean install` in order to generate the proper binaries. 

```bash
$ mvn clean install
```

The statement below is expected
```bash
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Once the build is completed, the `jar` is now contained in the `target` folder.

#### Run the multi-container application

- Still in the application root, run `docker-compose up --build`, and wait for the application deployment in docker.

```
$ docker-compose up --build
```
 
By default, docker runs in `localhost`, anyhow check the current host in `docker host` at Docker settings.
